This file contains a database design assignment based on a college database system. The main objective of the assignment is to understand Entity–Relationship (ER) modeling and convert it into relational tables and SQL queries. The database includes entities such as Department, Student, Faculty, Course, and Enrollment, along with their attributes and relationships. It demonstrates how to identify primary keys, foreign keys, and cardinality between entities. The assignment also includes creating an ER diagram using diagram software, converting the design into relational tables, and writing SQL CREATE TABLE statements with appropriate data types and constraints to implement the database structure.
