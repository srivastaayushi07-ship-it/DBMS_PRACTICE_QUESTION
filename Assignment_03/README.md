This file contains a database assignment focused on data collection and data insertion in a college database using SQL. The objective is to understand how real-world data is collected from authentic sources and inserted into a relational database. It uses the database schema created earlier and requires inserting data for entities such as Department, Faculty, Course, Student, and Enrollment. The assignment includes writing SQL INSERT queries, ensuring primary and foreign key constraints are maintained, inserting multiple records into each table, and verifying the data using SELECT queries. It also emphasizes using authentic data sources and maintaining consistency and accuracy during database implementation.
